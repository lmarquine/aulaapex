    <h3>What A Wonderful World</h3>
</div>

<div>
        <p>Red roses too<br />
            I see them bloom<br />
            For me and you<br />
            And I think to myself,<br />
            What a wonderful world<br />
            -------------</p><br />
</div>
<div>
        <p>I see skies of blue<br />
            And clouds of white<br />
            The bright blessed day,<br />
            the dark sacred night<br />
            And I think to myself,<br />
            What a wonderful world<br />
            -------------</p><br />
</div>
<div>
        <p>The colors of the rainbow<br />
            So pretty in the sky<br />
            Are also on the faces<br />
            Of people going by<br />
            I see friends shaking hands<br />
            Saying: "how do you do?"<br />
            They're really saying<br />
            "I love you"</p><br />
            -------------
</div>
<div>
        <p>I hear babies crying,<br />
            I watch them grow<br />
            They'll learn much more,<br />
            than I'll never know<br />
            And I think to myself,<br />
            What a wonderful world<br />
            -------------</p><br />

<div>
        <p>Yes I think to myself,<br />
            What a wonderful world</p><br />
